Demonstration files for the workshops for Ukraine demonstration of Power Bpy

This repository contains several files that I used or referenced a talk I gave on May 22, 2025 for the Workshops for Ukriane series. The talk was about Power Bpy, a python package I'm developing to create and modify Power BI dashboards using python.        

Here's a link with more details about the presentation and the Workshops for Ukraine series: https://sites.google.com/view/dariia-mykhailyshyna/main/r-workshops-for-ukraine#h.sj6g2dwadp0k
